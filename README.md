## 🎯 What is the Pomodoro Technique?

> _Work smarter, not harder._  
The Pomodoro technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. It uses a timer to break work into intervals:

- 🍅 **25 min** Work
- ☕ **5 min** Short Break
- 🌴 **20 min** Long Break (after 4 Pomodoros)

This cycle boosts focus and reduces burnout.
